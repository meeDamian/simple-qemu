# This Dockerfile builds `qemu` from source, and offers 3 alternative variants (`--target`s):
#   1. `enable`         - `qemu-enable` script alone (useful with own qemu binaries)
#   2. `single`         - A single `qemu` binary (can emulate one CPU-arch only)
#   3. `comprehensive`  - Contains `qemu` binaries for all built architectures

ARG VERSION=v5.0.0

## 1. This image has no `qemu` binaries in it.  It can be used to register/enable qemu on the host system, as well as
#   allows for interactions with qemu-provided `qemu-binfmt-conf.sh` script

# This Dockerfile builds `qemu` from source, and then offers 3 alternative `--target`s for packaging:
#   1. `enable`         - contains no `qemu` binaries, only the enable script
#   2. `single`         - contains a single `qemu` binary (for emulation of a single architecture), and the enable script
#   3. `comprehensive`  - contains all built `qemu` binaries as well as the enable script

## What follows is 3 Dockerfile stages/targets used to build different final Docker images
#

#
## 1. This image has no `qemu` binaries in it.  It can be used to register/enable qemu on the host system, as well as
#   allows for interactions with qemu-provided `qemu-binfmt-conf.sh` script
#   See more: https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/v4.2.0/scripts/qemu-binfmt-conf.sh#L172-L215
FROM busybox:1.31 AS enable

LABEL maintainer="Damian Mee (@meeDamian)"

# Copy-in the `enable.sh` script
COPY enable.sh /usr/bin/enable-qemu

# Verify that copied `enable` script is what's expected
RUN echo "94f44d6db8057ec67d825b5f34114d5574070fcdbcbde10f2ece515c85581504  /usr/bin/enable-qemu" | sha256sum -c -

# Copy-in the qemu-provided `binfmt` script
COPY  --from=builder /qemu/scripts/qemu-binfmt-conf.sh  /usr/bin/

# Make sure both are executable
RUN chmod +x  /usr/bin/qemu-binfmt-conf.sh  /usr/bin/enable-qemu

ENTRYPOINT ["enable-qemu"]



#
## 2. This image contains a single-architecture `qemu` binary, as well as all scripts necessary for set it up
#
FROM enable AS single

# Capture `ARCH` that has to be passed to container via `--build-arg`.
ARG ARCH

# Make sure that exactly one architecture is provided to ARCH=
RUN test ! -z "$ARCH" || (printf '\nSingle target architecture (ARCH) has to be provided\n\tex: docker build --build-arg="ARCH=arm-linux-user" â€¦ .\n\n' && exit 1)

# Copy the qemu binary for the selected architecture to the
COPY  --from=builder /binaries/qemu-$ARCH-static  /usr/bin/



#
## 3. This image bundles-in all just built `qemu` binaries, and scripts necessary for set it up
#
FROM enable AS comprehensive

# Copy, and bundle together all built qemu binaries
COPY  --from=builder /binaries/qemu-*-static  /usr/bin/

# By default only some architectures are built.
# Any PR adding a valid architecture will be added w/o questions asked :)
# As long as added architecture shows up in:
#       ./configure --help | grep -oEi '[a-z0-9_]+-linux-user' | cut -d- -f1

arm         # AKA: arm32, arm32v6, arm32v7
aarch64     # AKA: arm64, arm64v8
riscv32     # RISC-V 32-bit
riscv64     # RISC-V 64-bit

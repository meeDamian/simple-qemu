This project aims to make cross-compilation, and running programs compiled for a different CPU architecture _simple_.

Currently the only **host** architecture supported is `amd64` (AKA `x86_64`), and architectures that can be emulated are:

1. `arm` and `arm64` (AKA `aarch64`)


To be completed & improvedâ€¦
